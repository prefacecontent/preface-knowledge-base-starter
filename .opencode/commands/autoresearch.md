description: Run an autonomous research loop on a topic. Searches the web, synthesizes findings, and files everything into the wiki as structured pages.
---

Read the `autoresearch` skill. Then run the research loop.

Usage:
- `/autoresearch [topic]` — research a specific topic.
- `/autoresearch` — if no topic is given, ask "What topic should I research?"

Before starting, read `skills/autoresearch/references/program.md` to load the research constraints and objectives.

After research is complete, file pages into `wiki/sources/`, `wiki/entities/`, `wiki/concepts/`, and the master synthesis into `wiki/synthesis/`, then update `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, and `wiki/hot.md`.

Report how many pages were created and what the key findings are.
